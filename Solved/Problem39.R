# Let's consider a triangle with sides a <= b <= c
# The perimiter is a + b + c. 
# Since is right angle c^2 = a^2 + b^2
# So c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) and p = a + b + sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
# Very easily p = a + b + sqrt(a^2 + b^2) <= 2a + 2b
# p <= 2a+2b <= 4b -> b >= p/4

# For every possible perimeter get possible sides
